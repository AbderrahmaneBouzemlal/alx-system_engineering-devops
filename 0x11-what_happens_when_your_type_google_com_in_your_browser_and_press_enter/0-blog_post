🚀 Ever Wonder What Happens When You Enter a Web Address? 🌐

Hey LinkedIn! 🌟 Today, I want to take you on a quick journey behind the scenes of what happens when you type a web address like “https://www.google.com” into your browser and hit Enter. It’s a fascinating process that occurs in the blink of an eye. Here’s a brief rundown:

🔍 Domain Name System (DNS) Request: Imagine your computer is writing a letter and wants to know the address to put on the envelope; so it checks in its telephone book and gets back the address for the URL: https://www.google.com. The DNS server sends back the IP address of the required site. 

🤝 TCP/IP Handshake: Under this IP address, your computer creates a TCP connection to the server. This is like shaking hands, or making motions to make sure you and the server can talk. 

🔒 Firewall Check: If you are lucky enough to have a firewall, it checks to see if the request is permissible. Perhaps the server you are connecting to also has its own firewall and it also does the check. 

🔐 Secure Connection (HTTPS): Your browser ask the server for a secured SSL/TLS connection which means that all information transferred cannot be seen by another party. That’s why the “s” is put in the “https.” 

⚖️ Load Balancer: Larger organizations are known to have several servers leading a request as is the case with Google. A load balancer works in a way of a traffic police moving your request to one of the servers. 

📨 Request and Response: You make a request to your browser, it sends the request to load balancer who in return forwards the request to a server. The load balancer forwards the request to the server and the server processes the request and sends a response back through the load balancer to your browser. 

🖥️ Webpage Components: It consists of response that is a composition of the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that form the webpage. HTML defines the format of content, CSS adds beautiful view on it and JavaScript makes content active. 

📊 Dynamic Content: If there is a dynamic content like a search result that has the user’s name on top, the server can retrieve data from a database and then combine it or simply reply to the browser with the data. 

🧩 Rendering: Your browser reconstructs the received elements, making the webpage displayed on your screen. You look at a blank screen, type the correct combination of letters, it’s almost a light-switch mystery, and the page is there.

In the realm of web browsing, introduction of the browser with single click of the “Enter” key opens an incredible world. Starting from the DNS requests up to the actual rendering of the web pages, there are so many aspects that are involved. Networks find DNS addresses, distribute load balancing, secure the path through firewalls, encrypt data with HTTPS/SSL, content from web/application servers, and your browser assembles the final Web page. Such a process ensures that the internet remains a useful and a constantly changing entity for everyone.
